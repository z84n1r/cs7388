Civil 1810/9810 - Assignment 2Design and construction professionals frequently optimise the design and performance of temporary structures, such as scaffolding systems and concrete formwork. Their goal is to improve both the quality and structural integrity of these systems while ensuring the highest safety standards for users. Surveyors on atypical construction site employ advanced equipment such as total stations, theodolites, 3D scanners, and digital levels to support this effort.
Requirements for the assignment: Write a technical memo elaborating on the application (step-by-step procedure) of the surveying techniques needed to install temporary structures on a construction site (Constructing a Reinforced Concrete Residential Building). Focus on the tasks  that need to be undertaken to  ensure temporary structures are  installed appropriately (keep in mind the purpose of temporary structures). Ensure that your memo focuses on the role of  the surveying techniques in installing  temporary structures. 
Consider the following rubric when writing your assignment:

Introduction 
Provide a short 
explanation of the 
application of surveying instruments to determine the correct location of 
temporary structures in different construction    scenarios.

You may select a 
particular case study to   help you with this. And it is suggested to use the 
construction stage of the project, as this is when    temporary structures are used the most. Hint: You may discuss something like finding bearing angles and 
distances using surveying equipment for the 
purpose of connecting temporary structure to the main building. 
4 marks 
Technical sketches 
Present technical 
drawings to support the points made in the main body. You must use 
either AUTOCAD or 
REVIT for this section. 
Note: A good report 
should integrate the 
sketches within the body of the text. 
10 marks 
Conclusions and future technology 
Write a concluding 
paragraph summarising 
your general 
understanding and 
provide a couple of 
sentences about how 
specific future surveying techniques might change the way temporary 
structures are installed 
and designed (specially how they would improve their quality and safety). 
3 marks 
Overall presentation Your document should be clean,  neat, and easy to read. Your layout should be  well-thought out and formatted appropriately. 
2 marks 
Remember, 
You just need to explain how we determine the location of temporary structures onsite so that they can be installed accurately.
